# CBMC-examples
Each C file with CBMC annotations has a Frama-C equivalent. 

Our approach have been, until now, to get verification guarantees with CBMC that are equivalent (or close) to those from our P9 project.

We have currently achieved 100% SUCCESS in our checks using CBMC version 5.24.0

Verified files:
- arrayMax.c
- stringCopy.c
- stringCompare.c
